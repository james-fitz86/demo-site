                    History of the Shop
                </h2>
                <p class="indenttwo">
                    <span class="owner">James' Book Shop</span> opened its doors in 2021, nestled in the heart of a vibrant neighborhood that craved
                     a cozy spot for book lovers. Founded by <span class="owner">James Fitzpatrick</span>, a passionate bibliophile, the shop was born
                      from his dream of creating a community hub where stories come to life. With its warm ambiance and 
                      carefully curated selection of books, the store quickly became a beloved destination for readers of
                       all ages.
                </p>
                <p class="indenttwo">
                    In its first year, <span class="owner">James' Book Shop</span> hosted numerous events, including author signings, book clubs, and
                     storytime sessions for children. The local community embraced the shop, helping it thrive through 
                     ord-of-mouth recommendations. Recognizing the importance of adapting to the digital age, <span class="owner">James</span> 
                     launched an online store in 2022, allowing customers to browse and purchase books from the comfort of 
                     their homes.
                </p>
                <p class="indenttwo">
                    As the years passed, the shop expanded its offerings, including a cozy café serving locally sourced
                     coffee and pastries. This added a new dimension to the experience, encouraging visitors to linger 
                     longer. Today, <span class="owner">James' Book Shop</span> stands as a testament to the power of literature and community, 
                     continuing to inspire and nurture the love of reading in everyone who walks through its doors.

                        In this life-affirming novel by the author of The Midnight Library, retired Maths teacher
